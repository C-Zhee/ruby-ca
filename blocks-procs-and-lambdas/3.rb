# Quick Review

=begin

A block is just a bit of code between do..end or {}. Itâ€™s not an object on its own, 
but it can be passed to methods like .each or .select.

A proc is a saved block we can use over and over.

A lambda is just like a proc, only it cares about the number of arguments 
t gets and it returns to its calling method rather than returning immediately.

what_is_this = [ 1, "hello", :symbol, 12.25, true ]

filter = what_is_this.select { |stuff| stuff.is_a? Float}
